## Version alignment with gulp-cjs-tasks

As rule of thumb every tagged version of this examples project aligns with the
corresponding version of `gulp-cjs-tasks`. Be wary of the master and develop
branches, these are not released and the readme files contains references to either
the latest tag or a future tag.

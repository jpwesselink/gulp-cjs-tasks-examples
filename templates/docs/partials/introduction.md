## Introduction

### Description

### Putting the money where the mouth is.

All examples in the `./tasks` directory are fully functional and can be executed on the command line,
type `gulp help` for options. Note that this will not display all tasks since
some have no description and will not show up in the help task output.

Standalone examples can be found in `./examples`.
